# Project Name
> Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing usecase
 model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
Understand the factors which improves the demand for bikesharing.



## Conclusions


### **Model Summary Interpretation**

1. **Key Metrics**:
   - **Df Model**: Indicates 12 features (excluding intercept) are used in the model.
   - **Covariance Type: nonrobust**: No special adjustments made for standard errors.

2. **Coefficients and Their Meaning**:
   - **const (Intercept)**: The baseline value of the dependent variable (`cnt`) when all independent variables are at their reference levels or 0.
   - **year (positive coefficient)**: Indicates that the target variable (`cnt`) increases over years. Each year adds approximately **0.2421 units** to the dependent variable.
   - **atemp (positive)**: The apparent temperature has a strong positive relationship with the dependent variable (`cnt`), meaning higher temperatures tend to result in higher counts.
   - **weathersit_Light (negative)**: weathersit_Light  has a negative impact on the dependent variable, meaning higher the Light Snow, Light Rain weather tend to reduce the target (`cnt`).

3. **Categorical Variables (Encoded as Dummies)**:
   - **month_dec, month_july, month_nov**: These months have a significant impact on the dependent variable, with negative coefficients suggesting fewer counts in those months compared to the reference month (probably January).
   - **weekday_sat**: Saturdays tend to have more counts, as indicated by the positive coefficient.
   - **season_spring, season_winter**: Spring has fewer counts compared to the reference season (likely summer), while winter has a positive impact.
   - **weathersit_Light and Mist**: Light rain or misty weather negatively affects the dependent variable, reducing counts significantly.


5. **Implication**:
   - Features like temperature (`atemp`), year, and weather conditions (e.g., `weathersit`) strongly influence the dependent variable.
   - The model is well-fitted, with all variables contributing significantly.



### **Key Takeaways**
- The model explains the impact of each feature (statistically significant predictors) on bike count.
- Features with positive coefficients (e.g., `year`, `atemp`, `weekday_sat`) increase the target variable, while negative coefficients (e.g., `season_spring`, `weathersit_Light`) decrease it.
